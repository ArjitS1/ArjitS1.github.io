## Inroduction  to Data Structures -

A programming language has data types â†’ `int`,`float`,`double` etc which reduces the coding effort
Data Types are of 2 types : 
- <mark>Primitive Datatypes</mark> â†’ System defined types ex- int,float,array etc
- <mark>User Defined Datatypes</mark> â†’ User defined types. ex - structures in C,classes in java

### What are Data Structures ?

A way of sorting and organizing data in computer so that it can be used efficiently in order to solve certain problems.

### Abstract Data Types(ADT):

To simplify problem solving, data structures are usually combined with the operations that can be performed on them. This is called ADT. 
Ex - `Stack` data structure with operations like `push()` and `pop()`

Just like how primitive type int and operations on this type like addition(+),subtraction(-) etc can be done, ADTs are the same thing just user defined.

## What are Algorithms ?

> Step by step unambiguous instructions to solve a given problem.

An algorithm can be judged on:
- `Correctness` - Gives correct result in finite number of steps
- `Efficiency` - Time and Space efficient algorithms.

### What is Rate of Growth ?

Rate at which running time increases as function of input(as input increases, time to execute increases) is called rate of growth.

## Why to analyze Algorithms ?

Main Goal - "To compare algorithms in terms of running time and memory"
If we dont analyze algorithms, how will we know which among 2 algo is better for the problem at hand.

*Note  - Dont run after less time complexity, look for problem statment and requirement* 

## How to compare algorithms - 

In order to compare 2 algorithms ideally such that it is independent of machine and programming style -
We can express running time of given algorithm as  a function of input size n and compare different functions corresponding to running time.
**"_Expressing algorithm in form of expression_"**

Problem is same algorithm can be expressed using multiple expression.
Example - This is a search algorithm

```c
int search(int arr[], int n, int x) 
{ 
    int i; 
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) 
        if (arr[i] == x) 
            return i; 
    return -1; 
}
```

The above algorithm can be expressed as 
- f(n)=n in case of worst case(element found at last)
- f(n)=1 in case of best case(element found first)

To solve this problem and analyze algorithms in a more standard way we need some sort of Syntax and here comes into play `"Asymptotic Analysis"`


## Asymptotic Notations

Simplifying analyis of runtime by getting rid of details, which may be affected by certain implementation details

> If f(n) if expression of algorithm where n is input size, asymptotic analysis means approximating f(n) at higher value of n.

### Big-O Notation : Worst case time complexity

`"We are trying to find another function g(n) which approximates f(n) at higher value of n(Input size)"`

$f(n)=Î©(g(n))$   if there exists positive constant ***c*** & ***n0*** such that ***c g(n) â‰¤ f(n)*** for **nâ‰¥n0**

After certain input size ***n0, g(n)*** becomes upper bound of ***f(n)***

### Omega-Î© Notation : Best case time complexity

$f(n)=Î©(g(n))$   if there exists positive constant ***c*** & ***n0*** such that ***c g(n) â‰¤ f(n)*** for **nâ‰¥n0**

### Theta-Î¸ Notation : Average case time complexity

$f(n)=Î©(g(n))$   if there exists positive constant ***c*** & ***n0*** such that ***c g(n) â‰¤ f(n)*** for **nâ‰¥n0**
